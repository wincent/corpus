INTRO                                                             *corpus-intro*

    Corpus is a note-management application for Neovim.


                                                               *corpus-features*
Notes exist as Markdown files in a Git repository. Corpus provides:

- An interface for listing, searching, switching to, and creating notes.
- Bindings for creating links between notes.
- Optionally, automatic creation of Git commits after each save.
- Optionally, automatic creation of references for Markdown links.
- Optionally, automatic tagging or titling of content in Markdown
  frontmatter sections.
- Configurable rules for naming and linking such that Corpus directories can
  be used for local notes (eg. personal wikis) and hosted notes (eg. public
  wikis on the web).

If you're a visual person, the following screencast presents an early
version of the plug-in and how it works: https://youtu.be/KRlNBcYw74I

This screencast shows a more recent update: https://youtu.be/kmsKO0hfHx8

INSTALLATION                                               *corpus-installation*

To install Corpus, use your plug-in management system of choice.

Note that Corpus requires a recent version of Neovim.

COMMANDS                                                       *corpus-commands*

                                                                       *:Corpus*
:Corpus {search} ~

When inside a Corpus directory, accepts a search query. On the left side of
Corpus will show a list of files containing all of the words in the search
query. On the right side, it will show a preview of the currently selected
file. The selection can be moved up and down with the |<Up>| and |<Down>| keys
(or equivalently, with `<C-k>` and `<C-j>`. Pressing `<Enter>` opens the selection
in a buffer. Pressing `<Esc>` dismisses the search interface.

If the search query does not match any files, pressing `<Enter>` will create a
new file with the same name. As a special case, you can append an explicit
".md" file extension to the search query. This supports the following use
case: imagine you want to create a file "Foo.md", but your notes directory
already contains a file "Bar.md" that happens to contain the string "Foo".
In this situation, typing "Foo" will show the "Bar" in the list of candidate
files. Pressing `<Enter>` in this scenario would open "Bar.md". If you instead
type "Foo.md", you can press `<Enter>` to create "Foo.md".

When outside a Corpus directory, you can use tab-completion to switch to one
of the configured |CorpusDirectories|.

MAPPINGS                                                       *corpus-mappings*

In ".md" files inside a Corpus directory, "corpus" is added to the
|'filetype'| and a buffer-local `<C-]>` mapping is configured. Hitting this
mapping over a word turns it into a shorthand reference link. For example:
>
    if cursor is on THIS here
<
it will turn into:
>
    if cursor is on [THIS] here
<
In |Visual| mode, the selection can be turned into a link:
>
    if THIS IS SELECTED here
<
hitting the mapping will produce:
>
    if [THIS IS SELECTED] here
<
When the cursor is on such a link, hitting `<C-]>` will navigate to that file.


                                                                *<Plug>(Corpus)*
Corpus maps <Leader>c to |<Plug>(Corpus)|, which triggers the |:Corpus| command.
To use an alternative mapping instead, create a different one in your
|init.vim| instead using |:nmap|:
>
    " Instead of <Leader>c, use <Leader>o.
    nmap <leader>o <Plug>(Corpus)
<
OPTIONS                                                         *corpus-options*

Corpus relies on a list of |CorpusDirectories| defined as a Lua global
variable in your |init.vim|. For example:
>
    if has('nvim')
      lua <<
        CorpusDirectories = {
          ['~/Documents/Corpus'] = {
            autocommit = true,
            autoreference = 1,
            autotitle = 1,
            base = './',
            transform = 'local',
          },
          ['~/code/masochist/content/content/wiki'] = {
            autocommit = false,
            autoreference = 1,
            autotitle = 1,
            base = '/wiki/',
            tags = {'wiki'},
            transform = 'web',
          },
      }
    .
    endif
<
Keys in the table name directories containing Corpus notes. These
directories should be Git repositories. A tilde in the name will be
automatically expanded.

Values are tables describing the desired behavior for the corresponding
directory.


                                                             *corpus-autocommit*
`autocommit` ~

When `true`, Corpus will create a commit each time a file is written.

Defaults to `false`.


                                                          *corpus-autoreference*
`autoreference` ~

When true, Corpus will update Markdown link references each time a file is
saved. For example, given this text:
>
    This one [is a link] to somewhere else.
<
We will see references like the following created at the bottom of the file:
>
    [is a link]: <./is a link.md>
<
Defaults to `false`.


                                                              *corpus-autotitle*
`autotitle` ~

When true, Corpus will update the `title` in the Markdown frontmatter (based
on the filename) each time the note is saved.

For example, a file named "Some article.md" would produce the following
metadata:
>
    title: Some article
<
Defaults to `false`.


                                                                   *corpus-base*
`base` ~

When set, Corpus will use the `base` as a prefix when generating link targets,
which is particularly useful when the notes in question are to be hosted on
a public website.

For example, give a `base` of "/wiki/" and a link such as "foobar", the
resulting link target will be "/wiki/foobar".

Defaults to an empty string.


                                                                   *corpus-tags*
`tags` ~

When true, Corpus will update the `tags` list in the Markdown frontmatter
(based on the filename) each time the note is saved.

For example, given a `tags` value of `{'foo', 'bar'}`, Corpus would produce the
following metadata:
>
    tags: foo bar
<
Defaults to `nil`, which means that no tags get added to the frontmatter.


                                                              *corpus-transform*
`transform` ~

When set to "local", tells Corpus to transform filenames into link targets
in a way that is suitable for navigating between files on a local
filesystem. This is the "local personal wiki" use case. For example, given a
filename of "Shopping list.md", we have:

- A title of "Shopping list".
- Links of the form `[Shopping list]`.
- Link targets of the form `Shopping list.md`.

When set to "web", tells Corpus to transform filenames into link targets in
a way that is suitable for deployment as a public wiki on the web. Spaces
are transformed into underscores, and the |corpus-base| setting is prepended.
For example, given a filename of "Troubleshooting tips.md", we have:

- A title of "Troubleshooting tips".
- Links of the form `[Troubleshooting tips]`.
- Link targets of the form `/wiki/Troubleshooting_tips`.

Defaults to 'local'.


                                                                *g:CorpusLoaded*
|g:CorpusLoaded|                                             any (default: none)

To prevent Corpus from being loaded, set |g:CorpusLoaded| to any value in your
|init.vim|. For example:
>
    let g:CorpusLoaded=1
<
